Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =  10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 	10000
ii. Hours =	1562
iii. Category =	2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = primary key Id 	10000 distinct values, foreign key1= business_id, 8090 distinct values and  foreign key2 = user_id, 9581 Distinct values.
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo =primary key = id, 10000 distinct values, foreign key = business_id, 6493 distinct values,
viii. Tip = foreign key = user_id, 537 distinct values, foreign key = business_id, 3979 distinct values.
ix. User =  10000
x. Friend = 11 
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 	select 
								*
							from user
							where [column name] is null ;
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:  0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Not really, in the given dataset does not tell that.For further information we can use corelation between two columns using python. 
	
select review_count, fans
from user
order by review_count  desc

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are 1780 reviews with the word "love" and 232 reviews with the word "hate" in them.
		  So there are more "love" reviews. 

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select count(id)
	from review
	--where text like '%love%'
	--where text like '%hate%'


	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Generally, businesses that finish operating earlier have higher stars.

select  review_count,hours
,case
when stars between 2.0 and 3.0 then '2-3 stars'
when stars between 4.0 and 5.0 then '4-5 stars'
end star_rating
from business join hours on hours.business_id=business.id
where ((stars between 4 and 5) or (stars between 2 and 3)) and city='Las Vegas'
group by stars
order by review_count desc

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    not necessarily, no trend     
       
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	For part iii, I chose to compare shopping businesses in different locations
	 Cities such as Las Vegas, Toronto, Scottsdale are rated highly in shopping 
	Cities such as mesa are rated low

SQL code used for analysis:
select review_count,city,stars
,case
when stars between 2.0 and 3.0 then '2-3 stars'
when stars between 4.0 and 5.0 then '3-4 stars'
end star_rating
from business where id in (select business_id from category where category='Shopping')
and (stars between 4 and 5 or stars between 2 and 3)
group by stars
order by stars asc
		
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
      Average review counts for the ones that are closed = 23.198 however for the ones that are still open its 31.75  
         
ii. Difference 2:
      Average stars for the ones that are still open is 3.679 while for the ones that are closed its 3.52
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select 
    avg(review_count),
    avg(stars)
from business
where is_open=0
	
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
       Predicting whether a business will stay open or close. 
	 We wish not to explicitly examine the text of the reviews,
	 but this would be an interesting analysis.
  
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
      
	To better help businesses understand the importance of different factors which
	will help their business stay open. 
	Some data that may be important;
	 number of reviews,
 	star rating of business,
 	hours open,
 	and  location. We will gather the latitude and longitude as well as city, state, 
	postal_code, and address to make processing easier later on. Categories and 
	attributes will be used to better distinguish between different types of 
	businesses. `is_open` will determine which business is open and which business 
	have closed (not hours) but permanently.                                            
                  
                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
